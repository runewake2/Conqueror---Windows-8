Conqueror - Windows 8
=====================

A Windows 8 app for ConquerClub.com

Conqueror is a C# implementation of the ConquerClub api provided in multiple forms including a Windows Phone and Windows 8 version. Both of these are available under the MIT License on GITHUB.

The goal of Conqueror is to provide an optimized user experience for Conquer Club wrapping a number of useful features in a UI that is native to the Operating System they were developed for.

Conqueror for Windows 8 takes full advantage of the modern UI experience of Windows 8 to provide an experience that is immersive and helpful.

Feel free to branch the project and add awesome new features to Conqueror.

Currently Conqueror for Windows 8 is not available for download from the Windows Store. This will be remedied shortly as I sort out the last few issues before version 1.0.
